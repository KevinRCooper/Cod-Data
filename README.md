## Call of Duty Data Extractor

This is a simple web application that allows users to extract data from their Call of Duty data report. The report is an HTML file that is generated by Activision and sent to the user's email. The report contains information about the user's performance in the game, such as the number of kills, deaths, and wins. The web application allows users to process the HTML file and extract the data from it. The extracted data is then displayed in a table on the web page.

> Note: This application does not store any data. All data is processed on the client side and is not sent to any server. 

## Application

The application is hosted on Vercel and can be accessed [here](https://cod-data-extractor.vercel.app).
